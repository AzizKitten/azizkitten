        <section id="usage">
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p><li>mystery()</li> : This is a game with 3 diffrent levels. In each level you have to guess a number (or a number and a letter for the hard level) but you have a limit of attempts.</p>
            <p><li>mental_calculation()</li> : This is a game in math. You will get diffrent operations with numbers from 0 to 10 and you have 30 seconds to get the highest points possible</p>
            <p><li>root(num, nth)</li> : Find a root for any real number. Where <strong>num</strong> is the number that you want to find its root and <strong>nth</strong> is the index (default is 2 for the square root).</p>
            <p><li>quad(a, b, c)</li> : Solving a quadratic equation with all the steps including the sign board.</p>
            <p><li>among_us(PlayersNumber, lang)</li> : This is a good game to play it with your friends or your family. And it is not the among us that you know. This is a little diffrent. Every Player take the phone and register his name. He has a chance to be a crewmate or an imposter. If he got crewmate he will get a word that each crewmate will get it. However, the imposter will not get it. After you register your name press enter to hide what you get and give the phone to the next player to register himself. Therefore, the first one that he registred himself start by saying a word related to the original one. Then next player say another word and so on... But the imposter doesn't know what is the word so he tries his best to know them what are they talking about and say a word. After some turns anyone can stop the game and start voting. Each one vote for what he want to kick and who gets the most vote he get out of the game. If he is the imposter so crewmates won. If not, the game continues until the importer get kicked or still only 2 players so the imposter won. <strong>NOTE: lang</strong> is the language of the word (ar for arabic / fr for french / eng for english (default)</Em></p>

            <p>Let's suppose that 3 players still in the game. And one of them got kicked and he is not an imposter. So the game still will only 2 players (an imposter and a crewmate). Therefore, The game is over and the imposter won</p><img src="assets/img/imposterwon.PNG" alt="imposter-winning">
